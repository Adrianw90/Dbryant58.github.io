What style are you trying to create for your portfolio?
Have you searched github's available templates to see if one suites your style?
W3schools offer a ton of resources for HTML and CSS that could be helpful for example: implementing a navigation bar.
My best advice would just be ask yourself questions about what is required and figure out how to make those changes. -- 
-- A template would definitely be helpful to getting you started and there are plenty of templates either here on GitHub --
-- or just browsing through Google.
